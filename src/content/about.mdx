Once described as having the vibe of waking up on your birthday and having ten Weetabix for breakfast, Gents & Ginger brings the vibrant spirits and positive energy of their world straight to your eardrums.

This Manchester-based five-piece family feast, brings a delicious blend of old-school funk and rock with a modern twist. Their art reaches straight to the funkiness that lays dusty in all of us. As a well-seasoned band(wich), their curated sound is so uniquely flavoursome you'll be wondering why you never added enough ginger.

Off the back of their critically acclaimed debut album 'Githerments in Groove' and sold-out 2024 'Those Were The Days' UK headline tour, Gents & Ginger continue to light up the stage. And their infectious energy takes them from strength to strength, performing on the Nest stage at Truck Festival 2025, and appearing twice on BBC introducing - ushering in a new era of gorgeous grooves, nourishing nooks, powerful pockets, and undeniably danceable tunes. So, grab your Doc Martens, your stilettos, or those tattered converses, everyone's welcome!
